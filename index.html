    <p>Otherworld is a Metroidvania-style game centered around a robot who finds themselves 
        rebooting on a battleground, injured and incapable of complete movement. 
        Journey through a treacherous world collecting different body attachments, 
        solving various puzzles, and exploring to find secrets that might aid you as you figure out 
        what happened before you met your supposed end.</p>
